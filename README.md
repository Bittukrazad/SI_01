Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on COVID-19 Dataset.

This project involves conducting an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a publicly available COVID-19 dataset to uncover key patterns, trends, and insights about the pandemic. By using statistical and visual techniques, this project aims to provide a deep understanding of the dataset, identifying data anomalies and summarizing its main characteristics. The analysis will help inform decision-making processes, guide further research, and provide insights into the impact of the pandemic across different regions.

Key Features:

Data Loading and Cleaning: The dataset, obtained from Our World in Data, contains global COVID-19 information such as cases, deaths, hospital admissions, vaccinations, and more. The first step of the project is to load the dataset, clean it (handle missing values, outliers, etc.), and prepare it for analysis.

Descriptive Statistics:

A detailed summary of the dataset is provided using descriptive statistics. This includes measures like mean, median, variance, and standard deviation for key variables such as total cases, deaths, hospitalizations, and vaccination rates.

Visualizing COVID-19 Trends:

Time Series Analysis: The project visualizes how total cases, total deaths, and other metrics evolve over time using line plots for different countries, with a special focus on India.
Top 10 Countries by Total Cases: A bar chart is used to display the countries with the highest number of COVID-19 cases, helping identify global hotspots.
Hospital and ICU Admissions: Another visualization compares the trends in hospitalizations and ICU admissions across countries, highlighting healthcare system stress.
Country-Specific Analysis (India): A deep dive into India's COVID-19 data is conducted, exploring trends in total cases, deaths, hospitalizations, and vaccination efforts. This includes examining periods of peak infection, recovery, and impact on healthcare.

Correlation Analysis:

Using heatmaps and pair plots, the project explores correlations between key variables like total cases, deaths, vaccination rates, and population density to determine potential relationships and trends.

Key Insights:

Vaccination Efforts:

The project investigates the progress of vaccination campaigns and their effect on controlling the pandemic.
Healthcare Strain: Insights are drawn on how countries' healthcare systems coped with hospital and ICU admissions during peak times.
Excess Mortality: The project looks at excess mortality trends to assess the true impact of COVID-19 beyond reported cases and deaths.

Applications:

This EDA project provides valuable insights for:

Policy Makers:

By highlighting trends in cases, hospitalizations, and vaccination efforts, the project can guide policymakers in making informed decisions during future waves of pandemics.
Healthcare Professionals: The analysis on ICU and hospital admissions helps understand healthcare system capacities during peak times.
Researchers:

The project provides a foundation for more in-depth predictive modeling and research on COVID-19 and its impact on different regions.
